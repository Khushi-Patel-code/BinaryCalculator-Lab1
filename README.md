## 📖 Project Description
This project implements an unsigned binary number calculator using Java and Maven.  
The `Binary` class supports basic binary operations including:

- Binary addition
- Bitwise OR
- Bitwise AND
- Binary multiplication

JUnit test cases are provided to validate the correctness of all implemented operations.  
Screenshots have been added to demonstrate the successful execution of all implemented test cases and Maven build phases.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java JDK:** 21
- **Build Tool:** Apache Maven
- **Testing Framework:** JUnit 4
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code

## ⚙️ How to Build the Project

Make sure Java and Maven are installed.

From the project root directory, run:
```
mvn clean package
```

## ▶️ How to run the project

After a successful build:
```
java -jar target/BinaryCalculator-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

The program will:
1. Display the current time
2. Create two binary numbers
3. Show results for:
    - Addition  
    - OR
    - AND
    - Multiplication

## 🧪 Running Tests

To execute all the unit tests:

```
mvn test
```

All tests should pass successfully.

## ✨ Implemented Functions

The following functions were added to the `Binary` class:
- `or(Binary b1, Binary b2)`
- `and(Binary b1, Binary b2)`
- `multiply(Binary b1, Binary b2)`

Each function includes at least three test cases in `BinaryTest.java`.
